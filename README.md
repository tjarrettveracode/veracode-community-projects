=======================================

A collection of useful open source projects that integrate with the CA Veracode APIs to automate scanning, results retrieval and other tasks. 

These projects are community contributed and not supported by CA Veracode. For a list of supported projects, please see the listing of projects on [Veracode.com](https://www.veracode.com/products/core-platform-and-architecture/apis-and-plugins).

Automating common Veracode Platform tasks
